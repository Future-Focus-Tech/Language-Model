I am fond of pets. I have a pet dog. I call it Jim. It is two years old. It is very beautiful to look at. It is smart and active. It runs at an incredible speed. Its body is covered with a soft fur. It has a small tail and long ears.
I have in it a loving and faithful companion. It accompanies me when I go out for a walk. It begins to wag its tail when it sees me. It licks my feet. I like to play with it. I throw a ball. It runs after it and brings it back holding it in its mouth. It can swim. It answers to its name. It is very intelligent. It carries my messages to my friends. It runs after cats and barks at strangers and other dogs. It plays with small children and seems to like their company.
At times, I go hunting. It goes with me. It helps me track the game. It runs after hares, foxes, jackals and other small animals and overtakes them. At night, it guards the house. It is very sensitive to sound. At the slightest sound, it gets startled and begins to bark. A thief dare not come near our house. It has a very strong instinct.
Once a fire broke out in our house at midnight. It saw the danger we were in. It pulled my quilt and woke me up. It led me to the kitchen. To my great horror, I found that a heap of dry fuel lying there was all ablaze and the flames were rising to the ceiling, at once, roused from sleep other members of the house. In a few minutes, the fire was brought under control. This act of Jim endeared it to us all the more.
I take great care of it. I bathe it with soap every-day. I feed it on milk and bread. Occasionally I give it flesh and bones, too. It is treated as a member of the family. It is loved and liked by every member of the house. Visitors who come to the house also like it.
Several offers have been made to me but I am not going to part with it for any price. Separation from it is out of the question. It responds to my love. It is always by my side. It is a rare animal. Its fidelity is unquestionable. It is devoted to me.
